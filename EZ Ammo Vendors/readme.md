EZAmmoVendor

	collapses all ammo down into 1(2) entry(entries) in the ammo dump vendor
	refills all ammo of every type, (optional) including rockets
	enables you to buy ammo if youre full, if you want to for whatever reason
	in theory should also make loading the menu in ammo vendors less buggy/glitchy when backpack is full of gear, by removing unused entries 

use the filter tool's option for refilling all ammo in one purchuse if you want to refill eeverything at once
