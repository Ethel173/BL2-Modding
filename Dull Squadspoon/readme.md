# replaces the commerce

a port of the bright squadroon from TPS

	shoots to the upper left of the crosshair
	massive boost to max accuracy
	massive boost to dmg
	always has atleast 50 in mag regardless of parts
	moderate boost to status chance (its because bl2 is more hectic than tps it needed a buff alright)
	very slight reload penalty

this is too far to hit
