Seraphs Outside UVHM

	Adds seraph crystals to the DLC raid bosses drop pools in normal/TVHM
	Gives a 100% chance for either seraphs crystals to drop (approx 60%) or seraph gear to drop (weapons/Shields/etc. at approx 40%) 

EZAmmoVendor

	collapses all ammo down into 1(2) entry(entries) in the ammo dump vendor
	refills all ammo of every type, (optional) including rockets
	enables you to buy ammo if youre full, if you want to for whatever reason
	in theory should also make loading the menu in ammo vendors less buggy/glitchy when backpack is full of gear, by removing unused entries
