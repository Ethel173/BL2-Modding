Farmhouse 2 NSA

		replaces the fast travel to the "secret" farmhouse in tundra express with a fast travel to the creature slaughter dome for farming loot midgets
		you have to unlock the fast travel before being able to use it
		it DOES sequence break the game, but will not affect your save / story in anyway
		you have to save and quit if you wish to leave the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve *OR* enter the creature slaughter dome to be transported to tundra express
		if you get "stuck" / or if you save quit, the game will place you back "in bounds" of the story when you reload your save
